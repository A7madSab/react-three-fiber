## State Management and React Context ü¶Ñ

React Three Fiber is built as a custom [React reconciler](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html), meaning that the default reconcilar and r3f, while looking like a single entity in the code, are two separate trees. 
This implies that `context` IS NOT shared between different reconcilers, making it impossible to use the popular pattern of a central context-based state solution.

### Workaround using context forwarding

A possible workaround is recreating the context INSIDE the `Canvas` component while making sure you keep its value updated

```jsx
// this component will take a context and render inside our Canvas root node
function ForwardCanvas({ children }) {
  const value = useContext(context)
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <context.Provider value={value}>
        {children}
      </context.Provider>
    </Canvas>
  )
}

function Test() {
  const value = useContext(context)
  console.log(value) // 123
  return null
}

const context = createContext()
function App() {
  return (
    // we will use ForwardCanvas to keep the two contexts in sync
    <context.Provider value={123}>
      <ForwardCanvas>
        <Test />
      </ForwardCanvas>
    </context.Provider>
  )
}
```

### Use a state solution that doesn't need context

An emergin pattern is using state libraries that don't need context, but used different strategies to share data and keep it updated. 
[Zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand) was created with this problem in mind, as it uses a hooks-based API that doesn't need `context` providers.


### Note
This is a known problem in React and while there is no solution at the moment, the team is aware we will probably see some change on this front in the future.

### Tips and Tricks <a id="tips-and-tricks"></a>

This is the best overview I could find: https://discoverthreejs.com/tips-and-tricks

The most important is gotcha in Threejs is that creating objects can be expensive, think twice before you mount/unmnount things! Every material that you put into the scene has to compile, every geometry you create will be processed. Share materials and geometries if you can, either in global scope or locally:

```jsx
const geom = useMemo(() => new BoxBufferGeometry(), [])
const mat = useMemo(() => new MeshBasicMaterial(), [])
return items.map(i => <mesh geometry={geom} material={mat} ...
```

Try to use [instancing](https://codesandbox.io/s/r3f-instanced-colors-8fo01) as much as you can when you need to display many objects of a similar type!

## React performance pitfalls ‚ò†Ô∏è <a id="react-pitfalls"></a>

### ‚ùå Never, ever, setState animations! <a id="never-ever-set-state"></a>

```jsx
const [x, setX] = useState(0)
useFrame(() => setX(x => x + 0.01))
// Or, just as bad ...
// useEffect(() => void setInterval(() => setX(x => x + 0.01), 30), [])
return <mesh position-x={x} />
```

You are forcing a full component (+ its children) through React and its diffing mechanism 60 times per second.

#### ‚úÖ Instead, use refs and mutate! This is totally fine and that's how you would do it in plain Threejs as well.

```jsx
const ref = useRef()
useFrame(() => ref.current.position.x += 0.01)
return <mesh ref={ref} />
```

### ‚ùå Never let React anywhere near animated updates! <a id="never-let-react-animate"></a>

Instead use animation libs that animate outside of React! Avoid libs like react-motion that re-render the component 60fps!

#### ‚úÖ Using [lerp](https://github.com/mattdesl/lerp) + useFrame:

```jsx
import lerp from 'lerp'

function Signal({ active }) {
  const ref = useRef()
  useFrame(() => ref.current.position.x = lerp(ref.current.position.x, active ? 100 : 0, 0.1))
  return <mesh ref={ref} />
```

#### ‚úÖ Or [react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring), which animates outside of React:

```jsx
import { a, useSpring } from 'react-spring/three'

function Signal({ active }) {
  const { x } = useSpring({ x: active ? 100 : 0 })
  return <a.mesh position-x={x} />
```

### ‚ùå Never bind often occuring reactive state to a component! <a id="never-bind-reactive-component"></a>

Using state-managers and selected state is fine, but not for updates that happen rapidly!

```jsx
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

// Assuming that x gets animated inside the store 60fps
const x = useSelector(state => state.x)
return <mesh position-x={x} />
```

#### ‚úÖ Fetch state directly, for instance using [zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand):

```jsx
useFrame(() => ref.current.position.x = api.getState().x)
return <mesh ref={ref} />
```

#### ‚úÖ Or, subscribe to your state [in a way that doesn't re-render](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand#transient-updates-for-often-occuring-state-changes) the component:

```jsx
const ref = useRef()
useEffect(() => api.subscribe(x => ref.current.position.x = x, state => state.x), [])
return <mesh ref={ref} />
```

### ‚ùå Do not mount/unmount things indiscriminately! <a id="do-not-mount-unmount-indiscriminately"></a>

In Threejs it is very common to not re-mount at all, see the ["disposing of things"](https://discoverthreejs.com/tips-and-tricks/) section in discover-three. This is because materials get re-compiled, etc.

#### ‚úÖ Use concurrent mode:

Switch React to `@experimental` and flag the canvas as concurrent. Now React will schedule and defer expensive operations. You don't need to do anything else, but you can play around with the [experimental scheduler](https://github.com/drcmda/scheduler-test) and see if marking ops with a lesser priority makes a difference.

```jsx
<Canvas concurrent />
```
